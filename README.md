# Important Note:

The development of LabControl 3 is now moved to the original repository (https://github.com/miguelmoreto/labcontrole) in Branch name v3.

This repository is now archived!

# LabControl 3
The LabControl 3 is a simulation software for linear control systems. It is designed to be used as an auxiliary tool for teaching classical control system theory. It is a subsequent development of the [LabControle](https://github.com/miguelmoreto/labcontrole). Due to the numerous amount of changes, this new code repository was created.

The main changes from the LabControle 2 are:
* Using the functions from Python **Control** module.
* Data restructuration.

## New features

* Analysis data are stored in a list of objects (multiple plots in the same graph).
